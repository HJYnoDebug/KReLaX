Da in meiner Stadt die Inzidenz gerade steigt, überlege ich jetzt auch, wie ich weiter Kontakte reduzieren kann/will.

German,"Es ist mir aufgefallen, dass in einem Bericht (Zeit online?) mehrere Ärzte sich zu Beginn des Covid-Impfstarts der Hausärzte geäußert haben. Ein Arzt erklärte, der administrative Aufwand für die Ärzte sei bei dieser Impfung höher als bei anderen und durch die Priorisierung komme es zu Schwierigkeiten, sich durch Patientenlisten zu telefonieren, um Risikopatienten in die Praxis zu holen. Dadurch sei die Anzahl möglicher Impfungen neben dem 'Tagesgeschäft' sehr gering. Dies geschah gleich zu Beginn des Impfstarts durch Hausärzte und vielleicht hat sich etwas geändert... Wie sind ihre/deine Erfahrungen? Läuft es gut mit den Impfungen? Haben die Patienten viele Fragen oder Ängste durch die Nachrichten über AstraZeneca?
